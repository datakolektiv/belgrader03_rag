"1","In analyzing these issues, the contributors to HAL's Legacy have done us all a great service."
"2","Still, there are many things about HAL no one else could explain."
"3","I am a HAL Nine Thousand computer, Production Number 3."
"4","I became operational at the HAL Plant in Urbana, Illinois, on January 12, 1997.   -- HAL, 2001: A Space Odyssey (the novel)"
"5","""Oh,"" she said, ""Like HAL."""
"6","One of the questions she asked was, ""How realistic was HAL?"""
"7","HAL's Legacy seeks to do for 2001 what good art history does for a major painting; namely, make the viewer see it in a new light  -- a tall order, to be sure!"
"8","Clearly, HAL's Legacy differs from books on the making of the film or its cinematography."
"9","Now seems like the perfect time for HAL's Legacy."
"10","Birthdays are an important theme in the film (there are at least five of them), and in the novel, HAL ""becomes operational ... on January 12, 1997."""
"11","Kubrick changed the year to 1992 for the film version  -- perhaps to give HAL a longer lifetime and so make his death more poignant."
"12","On the 1992 date, I  -- along with colleagues, faculty, and assorted Silicon Valley friends  -- held a birthday party for HAL."
"13","I was interviewed by several papers, and an Associated Press photo of me cutting the HAL cake (shaped like his console, complete with red LED under a clear plastic hemisphere) appeared worldwide."
"14","I was pleasantly surprised to learn that much of the general public was interested in HAL too."
"15","Their care extended, too, to HAL, the central and surely the most memorable character in the film."
"16","But before we turn to HAL, we might ask: Why analyze the science in the film at all?"
"17","In Clarke's novel (adapted from the screenplay), HAL's birthday is January 12, 1997, whereas in Kubrick's passage in the screenplay it is 1992."
"18","A traditional analysis (centered on character development, plot devices, and so forth) might suggest that Kubrick wanted to make HAL's life somewhat longer in order to make his death more poignant."
"19","In fact, HAL's software could be downloaded onto a 1997-vintage computer in a few days (and wouldn't require inserting millions of floppy disks)."
"20","Could we build a computer like HAL today?"
"21","What might be the general design  --  the computer architecture  --  of a HAL suited to tasks as diverse as controlling a spaceship and discussing personal psychology with the crew?"
"22","How would the hardware support the complex software required to carry out the many humanlike functions of which HAL is capable?"
"23","Reviewing the progress in computer reliability, we can consider whether it is possible  --  in theory  --  to make the hardware of a massive computer like HAL reliable, especially for a prolonged space mission."
"24","Alas, the techniques for insuring reliable hardware are less effective than those techniques for software and, although progress in mechanizing fault-tolerant design and measuring fault behavior has been impressive, we do not yet know how to verify highly critical systems such as HAL."
"25","Although the game between HAL and astronaut Frank Poole is shown for only about thirty seconds, it conveys a great deal of information about HAL and the relationship between Frank and HAL."
"26","The fact that HAL can beat Frank at one of the world's oldest and most difficult games is clearly intended to establish HAL as an intelligent entity."
"27","The question of whether HAL's chess ability demonstrates intelligence boils down to a question of how HAL plays chess."
"28","If, on the one hand, HAL plays chess in the ""human style""  --  employing explicit reasoning about move choices and large amounts of chess knowledge  --  the computer can be said to demonstrate some aspects of intelligence."
"29","If, on the other hand, HAL plays chess in the computer style  --  that is, if HAL uses his computational power to carry out brute-force searches through millions or billions of possible alternatives, using relatively little knowledge or reasoning capabilities  --  then HAL's chess play is not a sign of intelligence."
"30","This chapter attempts to resolve this question by examining in detail how HAL plays chess and by comparing HAL with Deep Blue, the world's current premier chess computer."
"31","Finally, we discover that HAL's first error occurred in the chess game with Frank."
"32","Before we analyze how HAL plays chess, we need to put his game with Frank into perspective by understanding the history of man-machine chess matches."
"33","Frank versus HAL; Man versus Machine    HAL claims to be ""foolproof and incapable of error."""
"34","But, as we witness only one isolated game between Frank and HAL, how do we really know that HAL plays well?"
"35","HAL: Bishop takes Knight's Pawn."
"36","HAL: I'm sorry, Frank."
"37","HAL: Thank you for an enjoyable game."
"38","Having personally witnessed scores of amateur chess players lose to computers, I found Frank's reaction to losing to HAL extremely realistic."
"39","After HAL announces mate, Frank's pause is brief."
"40","This brevity is significant, because it demonstrates that Frank assumes HAL is right."
"41","He trusts that HAL has the details of the checkmate correct and does not take the time to confirm them for himself."
"42","In fact, Frank would have been utterly stunned if HAL had lost."
"43","No, playing chess with HAL is simply a way for Frank to pass the time on the eighteen-month journey to Jupiter."
"44","(As HAL is running virtually every aspect of the ship, there is little for the two, nonhibernating astronauts to do.)"
"45","We don't mind HAL winning, because at this stage in the film we like HAL."
"46","HAL was definitely ahead of its time."
"47","Another novel aspect of HAL was his voice."
"48","Before HAL, an actor speaking as a computer deliberately created a stylized, mechanical, ""robotic"" voice."
"49","HAL's warm emotional nature were even more striking when contrasted with the demeanors of his traveling companions."
"50","Their lack of human emotions accentuated the effect of HAL's amiable voice (see chapter 14)."
"51","I remember thinking that HAL's voice sounded ""too good"" to be mistaken for a machine."
"52","Later in my career, therefore, the movie 2001, and especially HAL, assisted me."
"53","My standard reply, that I worked on talking computers, generally drew a blank until I referred to HAL in 2001."
"54","HAL provided a better explanation of my work than I could devise myself."
"55","Actor Douglas Rain gave HAL his voice, and recorded all his lines over one weekend without knowing the complete story of the film."
"56","On the other hand, had this been an article on a rowdy headbangers' beach convention (a topic we assume HAL knew little about), the interpretation at the beginning of the chapter would have been reasonable."
"57","When Frank asks, ""Listen, HAL, there's never been any instance at all of a computer error occurring in a 9000 series, has there?"", HAL has little difficulty interpreting the last word as there and not their."
"58","HAL understands that the word their is an adjective and would have to be followed by the noun it modifies."
"59","Today's speech -- recognition systems would also have little difficulty with this word and would resolve it the same way HAL does."
"60",""" HAL resolves this ambiguity the same way viewers of the movie do."
"61","When we listen to other people talking  --   and people frequently do not really listen, a fault that HAL does not seem to share with the rest of us   --  we constantly anticipate what they are going to say ... next."
"62","Consider Dave's reply to HAL's questions about the crew psychology report:"
"63","When Dave finally says answer, HAL tests his hypothesis by matching the word he heard against the word he had hypothesized Dave would say."
"64","What we know about the world is difficult to set down precisely; but if we can't get that knowledge inside a computer, it cannot converse about any and all subjects as HAL does."
"65","Some of them might interpret this as a denial that a computer like HAL  -- that is one with HAL's language abilities  -- could ever exist."
"66","HAL talks just like a human being because the scriptwriters wrote dialogues for a human actor to speak."
"67","So how smart was HAL, really, and how does Arthur C."
"68","Clarke's vision of computer intelligence compare with the reality of the HAL-like programs we can build today?"
"69","If we wanted to bring a HAL-like being into existence, what are the millions of things that should be used to prime HAL's knowledge pump?"
"70","While HAL's performance in silence is far beyond current technology, computer speechreading systems using both image and sound perform better than their conventional ""blind"" counterparts, especially in noisy environments."
"71","The major tour de force of 2001, of course, is HAL, that magnificent computer with the forbidding stare."
"72","HAL was the embodiment of perfect technology."
"73","HAL's voice output is kindly, strong, and very human-sounding."
"74","With HAL on board, one wonders, why are humans even needed on the mission?  --  a thought that obviously occurs to HAL, who concludes that they aren't."
"75","Yet, the otherwise perfect HAL errs and only manages to kill four of the five humans on Discovery."
"76","Why, by January 12, 1997, the date of HAL's creation, the AI problem would surely be solved: computers would be able to mimic  --  and exceed  --  the highest achievements of human intelligence."
"77","I believe we are still a very long way away from creating a system as powerful as HAL."
"78","HAL: Dave, stop ..."
"79","HAL: Dave, stop...."
"80","HAL's expression of fear and his impassioned pleas no doubt struck a responsive chord of feeling in many viewers, for here HAL gives us the impression that he is not a heartless machine but a being who has genuine emotions."
"81","Many viewers feel a greater loss when HAL ""dies,"" than they do when Frank Poole floats away into space."
"82","After all, didn't emotion cause HAL to malfunction?"
"83","In fact, emotion appears to be a necessary component of intelligent, friendly computers like HAL."
"84","In the next few sections I discuss what we mean by emotion, what special emotional abilities HAL possesses, and some of the ways in which computers are becoming ""affective."""
"85","I then describe a paradoxical discovery  --  the importance of emotions in computers  --  look closely at HAL's disaster, and consider a dilemma regarding emotional machines."
"86","I think HAL was the most emotive of the bunch."
"87","It is evident from early on in 2001 that HAL purports to be a higher-order intentional system."
"88","But could something like HAL  --  a conscious, computer-bodied intelligent agent  -- could be brought in to existence by any history of design, construction, training, learning and activity?"
"89","If we want to trace the skein of moral responsibility in the actions of HAL, recent fiction has provided us with models - from RoboCop, to Max Headroom, to Blade Runner, which may help us understand the kinds of issues which we need to face in this kind of study."
"90","What issues would come in to play if we make moral judgements on HAL's behavior?"
"91","More importantly, what can we make such moral judgements about HAL  --  or any other intelligent computer?"
