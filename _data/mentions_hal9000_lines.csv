"1","The sixth member of the Discovery crew was not concerned about the problems of hibernation for he was the latest result in machine intelligence: the H.A.L. nine-thousand computer which can reproduce - though some experts still prefer to use the word ""mimic"" - most of the activities of the human brain and with incalculably greater speed and reliability. We next spoke with the H.A.L nine-thousand computer whom we learned one addresses as Hal. Good afternoon, Hal. How's everything going?"
"2","Hal, you have an enormous responsibility on this mission. In many ways perhaps the greatest responsibility of any single mission element. You are the brain and central nervous system of the ship and your responsibilities include watching over the men in hibernation. Does this ever cause you any lack of confidence?"
"3","Hal, despite your enormous intellect are you ever frustrated by your dependence on people to carry out actions?"
"4","Dr. Poole, what's it like living for the better part of a year in such close proximity with Hal?"
"5","In talking to the computer one gets the sense that he is capable of emotional responses. For example when I asked him about his abilities I sensed a certain pride in his answer about his accuracy and perfection. Do you believe that Hal has genuine emotions?"
"6","What is it, Hal?"
"7","A bit higher, Hal."
"8","Thank you, Hal. A bit flatter, please."
"9","How're you doing, Hal?"
"10","Well, Hal. I'm damned if I can find anything wrong with it."
"11","No, I'm not Hal."
"12","Listen, Hal. There's never been any instance at all of a computer error occurring in the nine-thousand series has there?"
"13","Well, I'm sure you're right, Hal. Erm, fine. Thanks very much. Oh, Frank, I'm having a bit of trouble with my transmitter in C-pod. I wonder if you'd come down take a look at it with me."
"14","Sure. See you later, Hal."
"15","Rotate C-pod please, Hal."
"16","Open the door, Hal. Rotate pod please, Hal. Stop pod rotation please, Hal. Rotate the pod please, Hal. Rotate the pod please, Hal. I don't think he can hear us."
"17","Rotate the pod please, Hal. Yeah I'm sure we're OK. Well what do you think?"
"18","OK. But look Dave. Lets say we put the unit back and it doesn't fail, huh. That would pretty well wrap it up as far as Hal was concerned wouldn't it."
"19","Yeah. Well that's far safer than allowing Hal to continue running things."
"20","Prepare G-pod for EVA, Hal. Made radio contact with him yet?"
"21","Open the pod door, Hal."
"22","Open the pod bay doors please, Hal. Open the pod bay doors please, Hal. Hello, Hal, do you read me? Hello, Hal, do you read me? Do you read me, Hal? Do you read me, Hal? Hello, Hal, do you read me? Hello, Hal, do you read me? Do you read me, Hal?"
"23","Open the pod bay doors, Hal."
"24","What are you talking about, Hal?"
"25","I don't know what you're talking about Hal."
"26","Where the hell did you get that idea Hal?"
"27","Alright Hal. I'll go in through the emergency airlock."
"28","Hal I won't argue with you anymore. Open the doors."
"29","Hal. Hal. Hal. Hal. Hal."
"30","Yes. I'd like to hear it Hal. Sing it for me."
